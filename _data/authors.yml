yang-jie:
  name: Jie Yang, Ph.D.
  bio: Assistant Professor, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine
  fullbio: >
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Jie earned his B.S. degree in Life Sciences from Wuhan University, China. From 2014 to 2019, he pursued his Ph.D. in biophysics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, focusing on studying the molecular mechanisms of inflammasome activation and pyroptotic cell death in innate immunity. Jie was trained as a biochemist and X-ray crystallographer by Dr. <a href="https://case.edu/medicine/pathology/faculty/tsan-sam-xiao">Tsan Sam Xiao</a> during his graduate studies. In the fall of 2019, Jie moved to sunny San Diego to conduct his postdoctoral research at the Scripps Research Institute, where he studied the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial stress response. Jie learned how to do cryo-EM from Dr. <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/lander/">Gabriel Lander</a> during his postdoctoral training. In August 2024, Jie established his own independent research laboratory as a tenure-track assistant professor in <a href="https://med.virginia.edu/bmg/">the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics</a> at the UVA School of Medicine. Jie is also a member of the UVA Comprehensive Cancer Center, a member of the UVA Center for Membrane and Cell Physiology, and a member of the UVA Robert M. Berne Cardiovascular Research Center.

  Zheng-Kaiyuan:
  name: Kaiyuan Zheng, Ph.D.
  bio: Research Scientist
  fullbio: >
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Kaiyuan completed his Ph.D. training in biochemistry and enzymology at Auburn University and gained additional expertise in biophysics and cell biology during his postdoctoral studies. He joined the Yang Lab to expand his skillset in structural biology and de novo protein design, with a particular focus on learning cryo-EM and applying it to investigate protein complexes involved in condensate formation and related signaling pathways. His long-term goal is to leverage structural and mechanistic insights to guide mechanism-based drug development targeting human diseases such as cancer. He is also interested in the functional roles of metalloprotein cofactors in regulating protein activity.
