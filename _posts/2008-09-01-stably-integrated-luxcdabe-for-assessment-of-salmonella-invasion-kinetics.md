abstract: "<i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium is a common cause of gastroenteritis in humans and also localizes to neoplastic tumors in animals. Invasion of specific eukaryotic cells is a key mechanism of <i>Salmonella</i> interactions with host tissues. Early stages of gastrointestinal cell invasion are mediated by a <i>Salmonella</i> type III secretion system, powered by the adenosine triphosphatase <i>invC</i>. The aim of this work was to characterize the <i>invC</i> dependence of invasion kinetics into disparate eukaryotic cells traditionally used as models of gut epithelium or neoplasms. Thus, a nondestructive real-time assay was developed to report eukaryotic cell invasion kinetics using <i>lux+</i> <i>Salmonella</i> that contain chromosomally integrated luxCDABE genes. Bioluminescence-based invasion assays using <i>lux+</i> <i>Salmonella</i> exhibited inoculum dose-response correlation, distinguished invasion-competent from invasion-incompetent <i>Salmonella</i>, and discriminated relative <i>Salmonella</i> invasiveness in accordance with environmental conditions that induce invasion gene expression. In standard gentamicin protection assays, bioluminescence from <i>lux+</i> <i>Salmonella</i> correlated with recovery of colony-forming units of internalized bacteria and could be visualized by bioluminescence microscopy. Furthermore, this assay distinguished invasion-competent from invasion-incompetent bacteria independent of gentamicin treatment in real time. Bioluminescence reported <i>Salmonella</i> invasion of disparate eukaryotic cell lines, including neoplastic melanoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and glioma cell lines used in animal models of malignancy. In each case, <i>Salmonella</i> invasion of eukaryotic cells was <i>invC</i> dependent."
