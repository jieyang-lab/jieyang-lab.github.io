abstract: "The G protein-coupled β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) signals through the heterotrimeric G proteins G<sub>s</sub> and G<sub>i</sub> and β-arrestin. As such, the energy landscape of β<sub>2</sub>AR-excited state conformers is expected to be complex. Upon tagging Cys-265 of β<sub>2</sub>AR with a trifluoromethyl probe, <sup>19</sup>F NMR was used to assess conformations and possible equilibria between states. Here, we report key differences in β<sub>2</sub>AR conformational dynamics associated with the detergents used to stabilize the receptor. In dodecyl maltoside (DDM) micelles, the spectra are well represented by a single Lorentzian line that shifts progressively downfield with activation by appropriate ligand. The results are consistent with interconversion between two or more states on a time scale faster than the greatest difference in ligand-dependent chemical shift (<i>i.e.</i> >100 Hz). Given that high detergent off-rates of DDM monomers may facilitate conformational exchange between functional states of β<sub>2</sub>AR, we utilized the recently developed maltose-neopentyl glycol (MNG-3) diacyl detergent. In MNG-3 micelles, spectra indicated at least three distinct states, the relative populations of which depended on ligand, whereas no ligand-dependent shifts were observed, consistent with the slow exchange limit. Thus, detergent has a profound effect on the equilibrium kinetics between functional states. MNG-3, which has a critical micelle concentration in the nanomolar regime, exhibits an off-rate that is 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of DDM. High detergent off-rates are more likely to facilitate conformational exchange between distinct functional states associated with the G protein-coupled receptor."
