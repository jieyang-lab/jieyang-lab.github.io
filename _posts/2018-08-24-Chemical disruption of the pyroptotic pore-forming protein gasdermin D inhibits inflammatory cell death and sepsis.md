abstract: "Dysregulation of inflammatory cell death is a key driver of many inflammatory diseases. Pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of cell death, uses intracellularly generated pores to disrupt electrolyte homeostasis and execute cell death. Gasdermin D, the pore-forming effector protein of pyroptosis, coordinates membrane lysis and the release of highly inflammatory molecules, such as interleukin-1Î², which potentiate the overactivation of the innate immune response. However, to date, there is no pharmacologic mechanism to disrupt pyroptosis. Here, we identify necrosulfonamide as a direct chemical inhibitor of gasdermin D, the pyroptotic pore-forming protein, which binds directly to gasdermin D to inhibit pyroptosis. Pharmacologic inhibition of pyroptotic cell death by necrosulfonamide is efficacious in sepsis models and suggests that gasdermin D inhibitors may be efficacious clinically in inflammatory diseases."
