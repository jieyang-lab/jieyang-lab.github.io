In addition to GPCRs and 7TM receptors, the lab is beginning to examine other transmembrane proteins important in human biology.
Unlike GPCRs, which all share a common fold, membrane transporters belong to a broad range of families and the molecular details of transport function are unique for each family.
We are particularly interested in human transporters within the Major Facilitator Superfamily and are leveraging our expertise in membrane protein biochemistry and pharmacology to understand how transporters function, how their activity is altered in disease states, and how it can be restored by pharmacological means.
