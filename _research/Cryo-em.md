We are interested in utilizing single-particle cryo-EM to determine high-resolution structures of macromolecular complexes involved in various biological processes. The Yang lab is developing a robust infrastructure that leverages the world-class cryo-EM and computational resources at the University of Virginia to determine the high-resolution structures of diverse macromolecular complexes, irrespective of their size, shape, and flexibility. This infrastructure also has the added capability to detect multiple conformational states from single datasets. To achieve this goal, we are advancing cryo-EM technology by enhancing sample preparation and data processing techniques. Our efforts have yielded success in engineering challenging cryo-EM samples through computational design. We fuse our proteins of interest with selected stable scaffolds or solubilization tags to increase protein size, overcome preferred orientation, and improve solubility and stability. We also welcome collaborations with local and national research groups interested in pursuing cryo-EM structures of their protein targets
