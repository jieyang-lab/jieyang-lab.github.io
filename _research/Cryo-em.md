We are interested in applying single particle cryo-EM to determine the high-resolution structures of macromolecular complexes involved in different biological processes. The Yang lab has established an infrastructure that effectively utilizes the world-class cryo-EM and computational resources at the University of Virginia for determining high-resolution structures various macromolecular complexes ranging in size, shape, and flexibility, with added capability to detect multiple conformational or compositional states from single datasets. to be continued...
