We are interested in applying single-particle cryo-EM to determine high-resolution structures of macromolecular complexes involved in various biological processes. The Yang lab is developing a high-throughput pipeline that leverages the world-class cryo-EM infrastructure and computational resources at UVA to solve the structures of diverse protein complexes, irrespective of their size, shape, and flexibility. This pipeline also has the added capability to detect multiple conformational states from single datasets.

We are actively advancing cryo-EM technology by enhancing sample preparation and data processing techniques. Our efforts have yielded success in determining high-resolution structures of challenging cryo-EM samples through rational in silico design. For example, we fuse our proteins of interest with selected scaffolds or solubilization tags to increase protein size, overcome preferred orientation, and improve stability. Additionally, we work to ameliorate the problematic behavior of protein samples at the air-water interface by using customized graphene grids. We are excited to apply our cryo-EM pipeline and capacity to different biological systems and welcome collaborations with local and remote research groups interested in using cryo-EM to investigate impactful protein targets.
