We are interested in applying single particle cryo-EM to determine high-resolution structures of macromolecular complexes involved in various biological processes. The Yang lab is developing a high-throughput pipeline that leverages the world-class cryo-EM infrastructure and computational resources at UVA to solve the structures of diverse protein complexes, irrespective of their size, shape, and flexibility. This pipeline also has the added capability to detect multiple conformational states from single datasets.

To achieve this goal, we are advancing cryo-EM technology by enhancing sample preparation and data processing techniques. Our efforts have yielded success in determining high-resolution structures of challenging cryo-EM samples through rational in silico design. For example, we fuse our proteins of interest with selected scaffolds or solubilization tags to increase protein size, overcome preferred orientation, and improve solubility and stability. Additionally, we work to improve the behavior of protein samples at the air-water interface during cryo freezing by using customized graphene grids. We welcome collaborations with local and remote research groups interested in using cryo-EM to investigate their favorite protein targets.
