<p style="text-align: justify;">
We are focused on dissecting the molecular mechanisms of cellular stress response, with a particular emphasis on mitochondrial stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, downstream unfolded protein response (UPR) and integrated stress response (ISR). Our interdisciplinary approach integrates structural biology (cryo-EM/cryo-ET), biochemistry (protein characterization), and cell biology (fluorescent imaging).
The main questions we are addressing include:

<strong><em>1.	<span style="color: orange; font-style: italic;">How do stress sensor proteins such as IRE1, PERK, and DELE1-HRI detect distinct upstream stress under different physiological and pathological conditions</span>?</em></strong>
<strong><em>2.	What are the structural mechanisms that activate these stress sensor proteins?</em></strong>
<strong><em>3.	How do they induce downstream stress-response signaling?</em></strong>
   
The ultimate goal is to modulate these stress response pathways in both physiological and pathological conditions, potentially leading to the development of novel therapeutics for related human diseases, including neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders, and cancer. To do so, we have also established collaborations with experts in disease-relevant mouse models to complement our mechanistic findings.
