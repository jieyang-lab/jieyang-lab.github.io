We are interested in dissecting the molecular mechanisms of cellular stress response, specifically focusing on mitochondrial stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and downstream integrated stress response (ISR). We employ an interdisciplinary approach, integrating structural biology (Cryo-EM/Cryo-ET), biochemistry (protein characterization), and cell biology (fluorescent imaging). Our ultimate goal is to modulate those stress response pathways in physiological and pathological conditions, potentially leading to the development of novel therapeutics for related human diseases, including neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders, and cancer. In addition, we have established close collaborations with experts in disease-relevant mouse models to complement our mechanistic findings. to be edited.
