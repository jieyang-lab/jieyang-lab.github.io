â€‹To attain the structural and biophysical goals outlined above, we utilize antibody fragments to stabilize transmembrane proteins in distinct conformations.
We are developing [novel synthetic antibody fragment libraries](http://rdcu.be/GMPh) and expanding on existing protein engineering platforms to facilitate this process.
In addition to enabling our structural efforts, we aim to utilize these antibody fragments to correlate structure at the microscopic level to function at the whole organism level.
