We are also interested in developing small molecule modulators of GPCR and transporter function.
As part of a highly collaborative effort, we [previously identified](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19112.html) a novel μ opioid receptor agonist using computational docking and structure-guided optimization.
This molecule induces analgesia with considerably fewer side effects than common opioids like morphine.
We aim to continue to leverage our structural and biophysical insights to identify novel probes of transmembrane protein signaling.
As with our novel opioid, we anticipate that these molecules will both serve as tools to interrogate signaling and as therapeutic leads in themselves.
