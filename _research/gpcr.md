Cellular communication is critically important in normal human physiology and is dysregulated in a variety of pathological states.
As cellular receptors for hormones, neurotransmitters, proteins, and even photons, 7TM receptors are highly versatile signaling molecules.
We aim to understand how these receptors recognize extracellular cues and translate this chemical information into distinct conformations responsible for signaling.
Our efforts leverage a number of techniques in protein biochemistry and biophysics, including X-ray crystallography, cryo electron microscopy, NMR, EPR and fluorescence spectroscopy, protein engineering, and receptor pharmacology.
We envision that a deeper understanding of these signaling molecules may enable tailored therapeutics capable of selectively engaging specific intracellular pathways and that these novel signaling outputs may yield novel biological outcomes.
