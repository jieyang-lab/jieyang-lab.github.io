# Join Us!

We are actively recruiting highly motivated graduate students and postdoctoral fellows interested in using integrated structural biology (Cryo-EM/Cryo-ET), biochemistry, and cell biology approaches to dissect the molecular mechanisms of celluar stress response. 

Interested graduate students should apply to one of graduate programs in the UVA School of Medicine.

Postdoctoral fellows should contact Dr. Yang directly with a CV, cover letter, and contact information for three references. We welcome applications from individuals interested in investigating the fundamental aspects of significant biological processes. Ideal postdoctoral candidates should demonstrate self-motivation, a strong research interest, independence, good communication skills, and a collaborative mindset. Candidates with backgrounds and expertise in structural biology, molecular biology, or biochemistry are preferred.
